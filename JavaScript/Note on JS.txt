- javascript is a client side programming language.
- it helps the browsers to understand user inputs and outputs.
- every browser is able to execute JS bcz they have JS engines installed in them.
- JS engine is an engine which converts JS code into machine code(binary lang)
- some popular JS engines:
Chrome--> V8 engine
Firefox--->Spidermonkey
Safari--->JS core

Variables is JS
---------------
-> they are used to store data in any programming language
-> in JS Variables are created using three keywords:
1. let keyword
Eg: let name= "Py";
- Variables created using let keyword can be updated but cannot be recreated(reassigned)

2. const keyword:
Eg: const balance= 100
- Variables using const keyword cannot be updated or recreated

3. var keyword:
Eg: var city = "Bangalore"
- Variables using var keyword can be updated and recreated


Logic programs:
1. Write a program to find wheather a number is armstrong number or not
(armstrong number is a number whose each digit raised to the number of digits sum=given number eg:153 )
1 pow 3 + 5 pow 3+ 3 pow 3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153


2. We are given an integer array, 
(name of array is asteriods of size n representing asteriods in a row for each asteriod the 
absolute value represents its size and the sign represents its direction + means right - means left )
Each asteriod moves at the same speed. 
condition 1 : if 2 asteroids meet the smaller one will explode
condition 2: if both are of the same size both will explode
condition 3: 2 asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet
to find out the state of asteriods after all the collisons 


rest and spread operator in js:
rest operator
-> this operator is used to destructure an array 
-> destructuring of an array means dividing an array elements into its constituent parts
-> this operator is always used on the left  hand side of the equal sign

spread operator
->this operator is used to construct an new array with the constituents of two exisiting arrays
-> it is always written on the right hand side of the equal sign.

Objects in js
objects are variables which carry multiple properties represented in key:value pairs 
we can access each prpty using . notation or square brackets
eg:

Document Object Model (DOM):
---------------------------
- DOM provides JS functions in order to interact with the html page.
- It provides functions to :
1. create a new element: document.createElement(tagName);
2. select values from form inputs: document.getElementById("idName").value;
3. capture html elements using idName: document.getElementById("idName");
4. manipulate the content of html tags using innerHTML: document.getElementById("idName").innerHTML="New content";


JSON :JS object notation
-------------------------
- It is used for data communication between the client and the server
- JSON is the string representation of a JS object
